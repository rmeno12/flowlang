# flowlang

flowlang is a programming language for expressing flowcharts and other discrete systems programmatically. Particularly, flowlang is useful for situations describing physical systems involving setting actuators in response to logic based on sensors.

A flow consists of two parts: device declarations and a series of blocks.

### Todo
- Syntactic correctness [WIP]
- Variable correctness (valid sensors/actuators, ranges for sensors/actuators)
- Visualization
